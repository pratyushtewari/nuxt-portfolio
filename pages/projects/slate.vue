          <h4>WHO WE ARE</h4>
          <p>
            We are SLATE—a team of two Masters students at Carnegie Mellon
            University’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute, a community
            dedicated to research and education in topics related to computer
            technology and its support of human activity and society. For our
            Capstone project, we were tasked by Vapor, LLC to investigate and
            envision the possibilities for a personal learning companion for
            high school students. We worked closely with two of our peers—Riam
            Chantree and Jamie Crawford—to determine a project scope and conduct
            our field research. Please refer to pages 55 through 57 for more
            information about the contributors to this project.
          </p>
          <h4>PROJECT SCOPE</h4>
          <p>
            Our client came to us with the vision of an elaborate personal
            learning companion built on emerging technologies. To make our work
            more manageable, we needed to specify a scope within this larger,
            more ambitious vision. After considering student needs in areas such
            as scheduling and organization, we decided to focus on
            <span class="inline-heading">METACOGNITION</span> and <span class="inline-heading">SELF-REGULATED LEARNING</span>. While there
            has been extensive research in other areas of learning and
            education, it became apparent through our literature review and
            expert interviews that metacognition is a relatively unexplored area
            with a high potential for impact. Please refer to pages 4 through 5
            for more detail regarding our area of focus.

        <h4>RESEARCH PROCESS</h4>
        <p>
          Although we used various methods throughout the research process, we gathered the bulk of our data from semi-structured interviews with 16 high school students. In an initial round of interviews, we aimed to develop a general understanding of each student’s approach toward activities and challenges. In the week following these interviews, we asked each student to complete a Learning Activities Booklet. In these booklets, students were prompted with questions about 12 activities, and their answers were used to further discussions about habits and learning processes in a second round of interviews. Please refer to pages 18 through 21 for more information on our research methods.
        </p>
        <h4>KEY FINDINGS</h4>
        <p>After transcribing each interview, we pulled relevant quotes from the transcriptions for use in an affinity diagram. With the affinity diagram as our main method of synthesis, we were able to group and discover interesting patterns in the data we collected. Our key findings revolve around motivation, competition, and the use of resources and self-regulated learning strategies. Many of these findings lead to insights that could be harnessed in the creation of a personal learning companion. Please refer to pages 22 through 35 for specific findings and supporting evidence.</p>
        <h4>VISIONS</h4>
        <p>With our research insights in mind, we created three visions of a personal learning companion that will target metacognitive development in high school students. Our first vision shows how a system might help students learn to assess resource credibility, our second vision shows how a system might facilitate a student’s help-seeking process, and our third vision shows how a system might teach students new learning strategies. Please refer to page 40 through 42 for a storyboard of each vision.</p>

      <h2>OUR CLIENT CHALLENGE</h2>
      <h3>
        To create a personal learning companion that inspires curiosity and guides students in their pursuit of learning.

          <h4>EDUCATION IN AMERICA</h4>
          <p>
            In the existing educational system, high school students often do not receive the individual attention and encouragement they need in order to meet their own definitions of success. We were tasked to address this shortcoming with a personal learning companion that will accompany students in their learning pursuits both in and out of school.

          <h4>OUR CLIENT</h4>
          <p>
            <img class="profile" src="@/assets/img/projects/slate/katzman.jpg">Our client for this project is Vapor, LLC. This company is run by Richard Katzman, a successful businessman who led the Katzman family business for several decades, bringing its yearly revenue from 4 to 500 million US dollars in that time. He has served on Princeton Review’s Board of Directors, and is currently the Executive Director of Learning Content at Noodle Education.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recognizing that human teachers are a scarce commodity, Katzman is determined to leverage emerging technologies in order to bring this concept one step closer to reality. He envisions an intelligent, customized, and adaptable system that will improve a student’s learning process by anticipating their needs and keeping them engaged in relevant material. Potential areas of impact that have been singled out include the organization and balance of academic courses, extracurricular activities, and social events, as well as the navigation and utilization of an ever-expanding library of online learning content.

          <h2>THE PROJECT</h2>
          <h3>
            To investigate the metacognitive needs of high school students and conceive a system that helps them become independent learners by addressing these needs.
          </h3>
          <h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
          <p>
            We are two students in the Masters Program at Carnegie Mellon University’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute, and we have been investigating the metacognitive needs of high school students for our Capstone project. This project is a culmination of everything we have learned about human- computer interaction, and this book is a report of the research findings and insights we gathered over the 2014 spring semester. These findings and insights inform our visions for the project moving forward, and will be used to support the development of future products.
          </p>
          <h4>PROJECT SCOPE</h4>
          <p>
            Our client’s vision is ambitious and multi-faceted. Recognizing that we would not have the time or resources to realize this vision in its entirety, we set to work determining an appropriate scope within the bigger project. In order to gain a better understanding of our problem space, we put together a literature review and competitive analysis, both of which are detailed in Riam Chantree’s Research Report. We also watched recorded talks, spoke with subject matter experts, and conducted guerrilla interviews with students from two high-performing private schools.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Topics we covered in this phase of research include motivation, <span class="inline-heading">METACOGNITION</span>, scheduling, teens, rapport, and learning technologies. Although there appeared to be a need in the space of scheduling and organization, we quickly discovered through our competitive analysis and guerrilla interviews that the market is actually flooded with various organizational tools students have no interest in using.

          <p>
            We learned from our literature review and expert interviews that <span class="inline-heading">METACOGNITION</span>, on the other hand, is a relatively unexplored area. It can be further divided into the areas of <span class="inline-heading">METACOGNITIVE KNOWLEDGE</span> and <span class="inline-heading">METACOGNITIVE REGULATION</span>, and the little research that exists suggests a promising opportunity for design and a high potential for impact in the latter. It was while exploring this idea that we came across a list of 10 <span class="inline-heading">SELF-REGULATED LEARNING</span> strategies in a paper by Nandagopal and Ericsson. Adapted from a list by Zimmerman and Martinez-Pons in a 1986 paper, these strategies became a reference for our research and are detailed on the following spread.
