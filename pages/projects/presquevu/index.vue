                  PresqueVu is A context aware reminder application that
                  triggers reminders based on your proximity to a designated
                  person.

                  How many times have to though you remembered something but
                  cannot recall it. PresqueVu is the
                  <i>tip of the tongue</i>
                  phenomenon, in which you know that you know something, but
                  can't quite recall it.

            PROBLEM SPACE
          </h4>
          <p>
            The market is saturated with time-based reminder application.
            Recently, with applications like Google Now, people can now set
            location-based reminders, which trigger reminders when they arrive
            at specific geographic locations. However, none of these
            applications effectively solve the problem of forgetting what you
            wanted to tell someone when you meet them. PresqueVu aims to fill
            that void, by allowing people to set person-based reminders that are
            triggered when the designated person is in proximity.
          </p>

            PROJECT SCOPE
          </h4>
          <p>
            The total duration of this project was 5 weeks. Over this period we
            engaged in the end to end design process and built a working
            prototype to demonstrate our concept. The project required us to
            take into consideration all aspects of a well rounded mobile service
            ie, viability, business model, usability, privacy and security and
            so on. While not all of these were built into our prototype, we
            presented a project report that covered all of these aspects. Our
            project got special mention for being one of the best 4 projects at
            the final poster show.
          </p>

          <h4 class="center">
            CONCEPT VALIDATION
          </h4>
          <p>
            We interviewed 6 people to determine if our concept was viable. The
            most common responses wer that people would feel uncomfortable
            sharing their location with others, and that they saw this as being
            a single feature of a larger productivity application. The most
            common use cases that our interviewees determined was to remind them
            about what they needed to discuss with co-workers in a work setting,
            and to remind them about previous conversations with the same person
            that they wanted to follow up on. We used these responses to guide
            the design of our concept.

            We sketched out the architecture of our application, to make sure it

            PRIVACY AND SECURITY CONCERNS
          </h4>
          <p>
            We brainstormed various approaches to ensure that our application
            respected the privacy of it's users. We decided to add a feature
            that informs users about reminders that have been set based on her,
            and allows her to accept or reject them. Instead of showing the
            exact location, we decided to only notify users that the people whom
            they have set reminders based on, are less than a 5 minute walk
            away. By adopting the above approaches, we dealt with the privacy
            concerns that had emerged in our concept validation phase. In order
            to ensure that users' information was secure, we propose encrypting
            all location information that was being sent to the server.

            BUSINESS MODEL
          </h4>
          <p>
            We propose a Freemium model to generate profit from PresqueVu. Users
            would only be allowed to set a fixed number of reminders for free,
            and would need to buy upgrades to set more reminders.

            FINAL PROTOTYPE

          <p>
            The final working prototype was a web application built using
            Express framework for Node.js that used Socket.io for client-server
            communication. We used Google+ login, and Google Maps Distance API
            in our implementation.
