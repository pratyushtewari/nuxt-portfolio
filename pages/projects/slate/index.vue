          <h4>WHO WE ARE</h4>
          <p>
            We are SLATE—a team of two Masters students at Carnegie Mellon
            University’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute, a community
            dedicated to research and education in topics related to computer
            technology and its support of human activity and society. For our
            Capstone project, we were tasked by Vapor, LLC to investigate and
            envision the possibilities for a personal learning companion for
            high school students. We worked closely with two of our peers—Riam
            Chantree and Jamie Crawford—to determine a project scope and conduct
            our field research. Please refer to pages 55 through 57 for more
            information about the contributors to this project.
          </p>
          <h4>PROJECT SCOPE</h4>
          <p>
            Our client came to us with the vision of an elaborate personal
            learning companion built on emerging technologies. To make our work
            more manageable, we needed to specify a scope within this larger,
            more ambitious vision. After considering student needs in areas such
            as scheduling and organization, we decided to focus on
            <span class="inline-heading">METACOGNITION</span> and
            <span class="inline-heading">SELF-REGULATED LEARNING</span>. While
            there has been extensive research in other areas of learning and
            education, it became apparent through our literature review and
            expert interviews that metacognition is a relatively unexplored area
            with a high potential for impact. Please refer to pages 4 through 5
            for more detail regarding our area of focus.

          <h4>RESEARCH PROCESS</h4>
          <p>
            Although we used various methods throughout the research process, we
            gathered the bulk of our data from semi-structured interviews with
            16 high school students. In an initial round of interviews, we aimed
            to develop a general understanding of each student’s approach toward
            activities and challenges. In the week following these interviews,
            we asked each student to complete a Learning Activities Booklet. In
            these booklets, students were prompted with questions about 12
            activities, and their answers were used to further discussions about
            habits and learning processes in a second round of interviews.
            Please refer to pages 18 through 21 for more information on our
            research methods.
          </p>
          <h4>KEY FINDINGS</h4>
          <p>
            After transcribing each interview, we pulled relevant quotes from
            the transcriptions for use in an affinity diagram. With the affinity
            diagram as our main method of synthesis, we were able to group and
            discover interesting patterns in the data we collected. Our key
            findings revolve around motivation, competition, and the use of
            resources and self-regulated learning strategies. Many of these
            findings lead to insights that could be harnessed in the creation of
            a personal learning companion. Please refer to pages 22 through 35
            for specific findings and supporting evidence.
          </p>
          <h4>VISIONS</h4>
          <p>
            With our research insights in mind, we created three visions of a
            personal learning companion that will target metacognitive
            development in high school students. Our first vision shows how a
            system might help students learn to assess resource credibility, our
            second vision shows how a system might facilitate a student’s
            help-seeking process, and our third vision shows how a system might
            teach students new learning strategies. Please refer to page 40
            through 42 for a storyboard of each vision.

          <h4>EDUCATION IN AMERICA</h4>
          <p>
            In the existing educational system, high school students often do
            not receive the individual attention and encouragement they need in
            order to meet their own definitions of success. We were tasked to
            address this shortcoming with a personal learning companion that
            will accompany students in their learning pursuits both in and out
            of school.

            />Our client for this project is Vapor, LLC. This company is run by
            Richard Katzman, a successful businessman who led the Katzman family
            business for several decades, bringing its yearly revenue from 4 to
            500 million US dollars in that time. He has served on Princeton
            Review’s Board of Directors, and is currently the Executive Director
            of Learning Content at Noodle Education.

          <p>
            Recognizing that human teachers are a scarce commodity, Katzman is
            determined to leverage emerging technologies in order to bring this
            concept one step closer to reality. He envisions an intelligent,
            customized, and adaptable system that will improve a student’s
            learning process by anticipating their needs and keeping them
            engaged in relevant material. Potential areas of impact that have
            been singled out include the organization and balance of academic
            courses, extracurricular activities, and social events, as well as
            the navigation and utilization of an ever-expanding library of
            online learning content.

            To investigate the metacognitive needs of high school students and
            conceive a system that helps them become independent learners by
            addressing these needs.
          </h3>
          <h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
          <p>
            We are two students in the Masters Program at Carnegie Mellon
            University’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute, and we have been
            investigating the metacognitive needs of high school students for
            our Capstone project. This project is a culmination of everything we
            have learned about human- computer interaction, and this book is a
            report of the research findings and insights we gathered over the
            2014 spring semester. These findings and insights inform our visions
            for the project moving forward, and will be used to support the
            development of future products.
          </p>
          <h4>PROJECT SCOPE</h4>
          <p>
            Our client’s vision is ambitious and multi-faceted. Recognizing that
            we would not have the time or resources to realize this vision in
            its entirety, we set to work determining an appropriate scope within
            the bigger project. In order to gain a better understanding of our
            problem space, we put together a literature review and competitive
            analysis, both of which are detailed in Riam Chantree’s Research
            Report. We also watched recorded talks, spoke with subject matter
            experts, and conducted guerrilla interviews with students from two
            high-performing private schools.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Topics we covered in this phase of research include motivation,
            <span class="inline-heading">METACOGNITION</span>, scheduling,
            teens, rapport, and learning technologies. Although there appeared
            to be a need in the space of scheduling and organization, we quickly
            discovered through our competitive analysis and guerrilla interviews
            that the market is actually flooded with various organizational
            tools students have no interest in using.

          <p>
            We learned from our literature review and expert interviews that
            <span class="inline-heading">METACOGNITION</span>, on the other
            hand, is a relatively unexplored area. It can be further divided
            into the areas of
            <span class="inline-heading">METACOGNITIVE KNOWLEDGE</span> and
            <span class="inline-heading">METACOGNITIVE REGULATION</span>, and
            the little research that exists suggests a promising opportunity for
            design and a high potential for impact in the latter. It was while
            exploring this idea that we came across a list of 10
            <span class="inline-heading">SELF-REGULATED LEARNING</span>
            strategies in a paper by Nandagopal and Ericsson. Adapted from a
            list by Zimmerman and Martinez-Pons in a 1986 paper, these
            strategies became a reference for our research and are detailed on
            the following spread.

          </h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            In his discussion with us, Professor Aleven highlighted some of his
            findings on metacognition and intelligent tutors in the context of
            our research. He pointed out that while it is possible to train
            metacognitive skills, those skills do not appear to remain once
            training has ceased. This transient nature suggests that a system
            able to prolong training effects could potentially help students
            develop lasting metacognitive habits.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Aleven also suggested possible opportunities in the transfer of
            metacognitive skills across domains. Although the possibility of
            this transfer is consistent with existing literature on learning
            principles, this area that has seen little research due to its
            daunting nature. According to Aleven, showing the use of
            metacognitive skills across domains could reinforce such transfer.
            For example, one of these skills might be self-explanation. Having
            students learn to explain concepts to themselves could help them
            understand their level of learning and how they might improve.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In addition, Aleven mentioned certain opportunities for design. He
            described teachable agents as one of the greater innovations from
            the learning sciences in the last decade, with projects such as
            Betty’s Brain by Vanderbilt University’s Teachable Agents Group
            incorporating metacognitive training.

          <p>
            Samantha helped us develop a better understanding of virtual peer
            systems. Much of our discussion revolved around teaching agents,
            teachable agents, avatars, authorable agents, and effective
            techniques to build rapport with each.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We focused in particular on teachable agents, which are virtual
            peers a student must teach how to solve a problem. She suggested
            developing virtual peers with a personality different from the
            student, in order to get students to think differently about the
            same topic.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In order to build rapport and engagement with the technology,
            Samantha suggested to include an awareness of the student’s culture,
            the use of colloquial terms, and a touch of rudeness in responses
            from the virtual peer. Her work has showed that an agent’s overly
            polite responses to rude inputs from students took away from their
            immersion. While we should be cautious and sensitive in our use of
            these ideas, simulating playfulness may increase student engagement.

          <br />
          <p>
            While Professor Koedinger discussed many values of metacognitive
            tutoring, he also brought up myths and nuances about metacognition
            that we should bear in mind. For instance, he suggested we exercise
            caution in assuming that successful learning comes from or leads to
            good self-regulation. Although his previous research has yielded
            positive results in using a tutor to change student behavior in a
            domain level skill, it has not been shown that those changes in
            behavior lead to stronger domain learning.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            It may be a similar case for students attempting to develop
            self-regulation strategies. According to Koedinger, those students
            may be no better off simply because they don’t care. While they may
            achieve success in exercising self-regulating strategies when
            prompted to do so, they are unlikely to use them otherwise. This
            suggests that any system we design to help in the development of
            metacog- nitive skills may be best paired with a system that builds
            trust in the value of those skills.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Furthermore, Koedinger discussed how different domains may benefit
            from different metacognitive strategies. Thus, while teaching these
            skills in a cross-domain system, we should ensure that particular
            strategies are taught in their appropriate contexts.

            Bruce shared his insights on cultivating motivation and getting
            students engaged in learning systems. According to him, researchers
            have been successful in disguising educational content in video
            games for the younger generation of students.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Keeping the vast collection of online learning content in mind,
            Bruce suggested building a system on top of existing curated content
            to help learners organize their searches. An important question we
            might use to guide us is how to provide the appropriate content to
            students based on their individual characteristics. Furthermore,
            some method of weaning students off any guidance and encouraging
            them to discover content on their own may prove highly beneficial.

            After listening to our brief about the Hobbes Project, Assistant
            Professor Ogan shared concerns about grouping students according to
            performance and/or potential. In particular, she suggested that
            labeling students as low potential could be extremely harmful.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Ogan also spoke of the ability learning companions have to improve
            students’ organizational skills by providing spaced reminders. These
            could be given when they should be studying, when they should be
            partaking in other activities, or when they should be doing tasks
            for classes in order to avoid a stressful situation when a due date
            approaches. Once students begin to trust the system, they may
            benefit greatly from its recommendations and be inclined to use it
            more frequently.

            Professor Rosé discussed the benefits of self-learning in students.
            She has found through her experience and research that high school
            students are easily confused by excessive information, and a “system
            that can teach students to look for and find information on their
            own” will help them become more able self-sufficient learners.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            At the same time, Rosé’s research shows that “self-regulated
            learning is unrealistic because students are not motivated to go out
            and do anything extra.” She questioned the validity of optional work
            and suggested that a system designed to help students finish their
            homework might be more exciting. In terms of maintaining motivation,
            she has found that “lots of people struggle to keep up and get
            discouraged and then give up.” This limitation presents an
            opportunity for us to create a system that will encourage students
            to engage in self-regulation and become better independent learners.
